This is the ReadMe for the programming assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data

This script does essentially 5 things.

First: it loads data from a set of files in the given zip. Activity and feature labels, and training and testing data.
Second: it combines the training and testing data with appropriate labelling
Third: it extracts the data on mean and standard deviation
Fourth: it labels the data by subject
Fifth: it creates a separate data file called tidy.txt which includes only mean data for each variable
